## Project Overview

This project analyzes the movie industry from 2010 to 2018. The descriptive analytics provides insights on genres that are highly rated, have high production budgets and grossing. The projects also helps explore the relationships between different features including production budget and runtime, production budget and grossing, and domestic and foreign grossing. Microsoft can use the information to make data driven decision on the content that they should focus on.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

 Questions asked during the analytics:

  1. What were the movie trends from 2010 - 2018 (i.e. how many movies per genre were produce each year)?
  2. Which were the highest rated genres?
  3. Which genres had the highest production budget?
  4. Was there a correlation betwee production budget and runtime?
  5. Was there a correlation between production budget and World wide gross profit?
  6. Which genre had the highest Estimated gross profit?
  7. Was there a correlation between domestic gross profit and foreign gross profit?
 
 From the analysis, the results will help Microsoft understand:

  1. Which genres to focus on in terms of averageratings and estimated gross profit
  2. Production budgets for each genres
  3. How production budget translates to gross profit
  4. The correlation between how a movie performs domestically and internationally

### Data Sources

The datasets applied in this project were sourced from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


### Methods
Steps followed:

Importing relevant packages used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scipy

### Data Preparation
  1. Data Extraction :
  
The below datasets were extracted for this analysis:
   - tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz 
   - bom.movie_gross.csv.gz 
   - imdb.title.basics.csv.gz 
   - imdb.title.akas.csv.gz 
   - rt.movie_info.tsv.gz
   
  2. Data cleaning
  
 To ensure that data was clean for analysis, the following was done
 
  - Removed duplicates
  - Used built-in methods to identify and deal with missing values (NaN) 
  - Removed irrelevant columns and rows

 3. Data Wrangling
 
 For easy data analysis and visualization the following was done to form one dataframe especially for the imdb datasets
  - Combining Data
  - Indexing Data
  - Dealing with Categorical Data
  
  4. Data Analysis
This project used descriptive analytics including changes in trends over time & comparitive analysis between film features. This provides meanigul insight in movie industry trends that could help the Microsoft team make well informed decision in their new potencial venture in the film industry.

### Conclusion

Key takeaways:

1. Multi-genre films perform well than single-genre films
2. Action and Adventure|Classics|Drama had the highest production budget and estimated gross profit
3. There's no relationship between runtime for a movie and production budget and vice versa
4. Films that perform well domestically will perform well internationally
5. There's a positive correlation between production budget and gross profits

### Recommendation

1. Microsoft should target to produce more multi-genre films with a key focus on Action and Adventure|Classics|Drama

### Further Work
1. Compare studio productions and identify those that have successfully done low-budget films with high grossing
2. Analyze how many movies Microsoft should produce per year
3. Analyze the best time of the year (month) to release different film genres
